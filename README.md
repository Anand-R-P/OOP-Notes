# OOP-Notes


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP focuses on creating reusable code by organizing it into objects, which can be instantiated and used multiple times.

Here are the major concepts of OOP with simpler explanations and examples:

## Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have. For example, a class "Car" might have properties such as "make", "model", "year", and methods such as "start", "stop", and "accelerate".

## Object
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It contains the actual data and behavior of the class. For example, an object of the class "Car" might have the data "make: Honda", "model: Civic", "year: 2021", and behavior such as "start the engine".

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world. It ensures that the object can only be accessed through a defined set of methods and properties. For example, a class "BankAccount" might have private properties such as "accountNumber" and "balance", which can only be accessed through public methods such as "deposit" and "withdraw".

## Inheritance
Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability to create new classes based on existing ones. The new class inherits all the properties and methods of the base class and can add new ones or override existing ones. For example, a class "SUV" might inherit from the class "Car" and add new properties such as "seating capacity" and methods such as "enable 4-wheel drive".

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on different forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. For example, a class "Shape" might have methods such as "calculateArea" and "calculatePerimeter", and subclasses such as "Circle" and "Rectangle" which override these methods to provide their own implementations.

## Abstraction 
Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying the essential features of an object and ignoring the rest. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. In OOP, abstraction is achieved by defining interfaces that specify the behavior of an object without revealing its internal details. For example, a class "Animal" might have an abstract method "makeSound", which is implemented differently by subclasses such as "Dog", "Cat", and "Bird".

Overall, OOP is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. By organizing code into objects and using concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, developers can create robust and scalable applications that are easier to extend and maintain.
